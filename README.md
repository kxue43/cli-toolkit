# Personal CLI Toolkit

Toolkit of various CLI programs that aid my own workflows.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kxue43/cli-toolkit/cmd/toolkit@latest
```

## Usage

The `toolkit assume-role` command only works on Linux or macOS because it needs to read and write `/dev/tty`.
Other commands work on all operating systems.
