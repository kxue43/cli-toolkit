## Live Reload Server

You can use a local live-reload server to read your rendered documents while you are writing them.

The live-reload server relies on two executable Go programs. To use them, first install Go and then run the following
two commands.

```bash
go install github.com/kxue43/cli-toolkit/cmd/toolkit-serve-static@latest
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

The executables are installed at `GOBIN`, which by default is `GOPATH/bin`. Make sure the installation folder is on
your `PATH`. You can use the following commands to query the Go environment information.

```bash
go env GOBIN
go env GOPATH
```

To start the server, run the following command from the folder than contains the `.air.toml` file.
Then, in your browser, go to `localhost:8080`.

```bash
air
```

Note that by default the live-reload server only watches generated static files in the `_build/html` folder,
not your source `.rst` files. When you want to view the changes,
you need to run `make html` to regenerate static files first.
It is possible to update configurations in `.air.toml` so that the server reloads on `.rst` changes.
Please consult the [air-verse/air](https://github.com/air-verse/air/blob/master/air_example.toml)
documentation on how to do that.
